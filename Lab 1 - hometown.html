        <h1>City of Ottawa - Ville d'Ottawa</h1>
        <h2>Canada's Capital - Architecture and <a href="table.html">Wildlife</a> </h2>
        <p>Situated at the confluence of two powerful rivers and the historic Rideau Canal, Ottawa
        is home to over 1 million inhabitants and is the seat of Canada's federal government.
        A popular destination for tourists (estd. 22 million annually), there are a number of outdoor activities 
        for visitors to partake in during every season. From Winterlude to Tulip Festival in the spring, Bluesfest
        and City Folk music festivals to the changing of the leaves in the fall. Ottawa also features a number of 
        world-class galleries and museums to visit when the weather isn't co-operating!

        <p>Historically, Ottawa's skyline was stunted by bylaws requiring all buildings be built shorter 
            than the 92 m Peace Tower of Parliament Hill. That law was repealed in 1965, however the city
            still adheres to a strict and complicated system of view planes that limit building heights. 
            This has resulted in Ottawa having fewer tall buildings than other comparably sized Canadian cities.</p>
        <h3>Ottawa's Tallest Buildings Over 100 m</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Claridge Icon, Little Italy (143 m)</li>
            <li>Place de Ville - Tower C, Downtown (112 m)</li>
            <li>Minto Metropole, Westboro (108 m)</li>

            <li>Le Parc, Manor Park (104 m)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Ottawa features a number of architecturally distinct buildings in various styles, mostly shaped by 
            the presence of the federal government (for better or worse).</p>
